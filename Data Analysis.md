- The model trained with all the data showed robust performance in predicting the final state of the projects. LightGBM, assessed by five-fold stratified cross-validation, achieved a mean ROC-AUC of 0.800 ±0.001, indicating good discriminatory ability between successful and unsuccessful projects (Figure 1). These values demonstrate that the model was able to stably capture relevant patterns in the variables related to the breeder.

- Early crowdfunding modeling initiatives had already demonstrated the potential of computational approaches in which predictive algorithms achieved about 68% accuracy in the classification of campaigns (Greenberg et al., 2013). The present model, with a mean ROC-AUC of 0.80, adds to this result a more stable and high discriminatory capacity, evidencing the maturity of both the available data and the techniques applied to the problem. However, the still imperfect predictive capacity suggests that the set of features analyzed captures the factors under the creator's control, such as financial goals, duration, category and reputation, a significant part of the variability in the success of the projects depends on elements external to these parameters. Among them are individual marketing actions, engagement in social networks (Hsu, 2007), curation of the platform itself ("staff pick" and "spotlight" in the original database) and contextual factors such as economic conjunctures or cultural trends that affect audience engagement. Thus, the model shows robust predictive capacity, but also highlights the limits imposed by the absence of variables related to factors extrinsic to the breeder.

- The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis used to measure the importance of each feature used in the LightGBM model provides answers about the interaction of these variables with the increase in the probability of project success (Figure 2). The "Financial Goal" metric is inversely related to success, where larger goals lead to greater difficulty in the success of the campaign while smaller goals facilitate its successful financing. "Campaign duration" revealed a non-linear pattern in which short periods tend to increase the probability of success compared to long campaigns, but with inversion at the extremes, where excessively short durations reduce the reach of the initiative, while very long durations although less engaging can still lead to positive results at a more gradual pace. "Reputation" is represented in its levels "Always Success", strongly associated with the probability of success, and "Partial Success", also associated with success, but less influential. The categories present heterogeneous results where certain groups such as "design", "comics" and "games" contribute to the success of the project, while "journalism" is a negative factor.

- High targets operate as coordination barriers because they require broad mobilization of funders and increase the perceived risk that the project will never succeed. Realistic goals reduce financial and psychological costs of entry and increase the chance of successful financing. Campaign duration expresses the balance between urgency and reach, moderate timeframes maintain audience engagement without exhausting attention, windows that are too short limit reach, and windows that are too long dilute the sense of timing and lose interest. Reputation works as a sign of reliability, entirely successful portfolios suggest opportunities that will be realized and delivered, anchoring expectations of supporters. Finally, the categories introduce a cultural and marketing component, segments with established popular communities and flashy rewards ("Comics") tend to receive more attention than niches with a diffuse audience or present in other media ("Journalism").

- The training of the model on annual time slices revealed a positive and consistent evolution in predictive performance over time (Figure 3). While in the first years of the platform (2009 and 2010) the ROC-AUC was between 0.60 and 0.70, indicating uncertain forecasts, from 2012 onwards the performance stabilizes close to 0.80. In recent years, especially after 2018, the model reached values above 0.85 and remained at a high level until the last period analyzed. This result shows that as the project base grew and matured, the model became more robust in discriminating between successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

- The progressive improvement in performance suggests that Kickstarter has gradually become more predictable, with factors under the direct influence of creators, financial goals, duration, categories, and reputation, accounting for an increasing share of the success of campaigns. This pattern indicates not only the increase in the relevance of the structural variables analyzed, but also the probable relative reduction in the influence of external and qualitative factors, such as individual marketing or platform curation, which played a more decisive role in the first years. Crowdfunding on Kickstarter has evolved into a more mathematical and data-dependent landscape, where the creator's track record and strategic choices play increasing weight, making results less dependent on intangible factors. However, the qualitative component does not disappear, its impact on the prediction of success diminishes, but it persists as a source of residual variation.

- The analysis of the variable "duration" revealed clear changes in the pattern of the campaigns over time (Figure 4). In the early years of Kickstarter there was a heterogeneous distribution of deadlines, with greater dispersion between 20 and 60 days. From 2011 onwards, however, the predominance of 30-day campaigns was consolidated, which quickly became the dominant pattern of the platform. Alternate durations in multiples of five days, such as 15, 20, 45, and 60 days, remained secondary choices with much lower frequency. This standardization process indicates not only an adaptation of creators to the most popular and effective practices, but also the maturation of the platform itself, which began to consolidate expectations and norms around more defined and recognizable deadlines.
