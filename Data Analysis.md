### Results and DIscussion

- The model trained with all the data showed robust performance in predicting the final state of the projects. LightGBM, assessed by five-fold stratified cross-validation, achieved a mean ROC-AUC of 0.800 ±0.001, indicating good discriminatory ability between successful and unsuccessful projects (Figure 1). These values demonstrate that the model was able to stably capture relevant patterns in the variables related to the breeder.

Figure 1. ROC curve of the trained LightGBM model with stratified cross-validation (k = 5).True positives are successfully funded Kickstarter projects and correctly predicted as such, while false positives are projects that did not reach their goal but were mistakenly classified as successful.

- Early crowdfunding modeling initiatives had already demonstrated the potential of computational approaches in which predictive algorithms achieved about 68% accuracy in the classification of campaigns (Greenberg et al., 2013). The present model, with a mean ROC-AUC of 0.80, adds to this result a more stable and high discriminatory capacity, evidencing the maturity of both the available data and the techniques applied to the problem. However, the still imperfect predictive capacity suggests that the set of features analyzed captures the factors under the creator's control, such as financial goals, duration, category and reputation, a significant part of the variability in the success of the projects depends on elements external to these parameters. Among them are individual marketing actions, engagement in social networks (Hsu, 2007), curation of the platform itself ("staff pick" and "spotlight" in the original database) and contextual factors such as economic conjunctures or cultural trends that affect audience engagement. Thus, the model shows robust predictive capacity, but also highlights the limits imposed by the absence of variables related to factors extrinsic to the breeder.

- The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis used to measure the importance of each feature used in the LightGBM model provides answers about the interaction of these variables with the increase in the probability of project success (Figure 2). The "Financial Goal" metric is inversely related to success, where larger goals lead to greater difficulty in the success of the campaign while smaller goals facilitate its successful financing. "Campaign duration" revealed a non-linear pattern in which short periods tend to increase the probability of success compared to long campaigns, but with inversion at the extremes, where excessively short durations reduce the reach of the initiative, while very long durations although less engaging can still lead to positive results at a more gradual pace. "Reputation" is represented in its levels "Always Success", strongly associated with the probability of success, and "Partial Success", also associated with success, but less influential. The categories present heterogeneous results where certain groups such as "design", "comics" and "games" contribute to the success of the project, while "journalism" is a negative factor.

- High targets operate as coordination barriers because they require broad mobilization of funders and increase the perceived risk that the project will never succeed. Realistic goals reduce financial and psychological costs of entry and increase the chance of successful financing. Campaign duration expresses the balance between urgency and reach, moderate timeframes maintain audience engagement without exhausting attention, windows that are too short limit reach, and windows that are too long dilute the sense of timing and lose interest. Reputation works as a sign of reliability, entirely successful portfolios suggest opportunities that will be realized and delivered, anchoring expectations of supporters. Finally, the categories introduce a cultural and marketing component, segments with established popular communities and flashy rewards ("Comics") tend to receive more attention than niches with a diffuse audience or present in other media ("Journalism").

- The training of the model on annual time slices revealed a positive and consistent evolution in predictive performance over time (Figure 3). While in the first years of the platform (2009 and 2010) the ROC-AUC was between 0.60 and 0.70, indicating uncertain forecasts, from 2012 onwards the performance stabilizes close to 0.80. In recent years, especially after 2018, the model reached values above 0.85 and remained at a high level until the last period analyzed. This result shows that as the project base grew and matured, the model became more robust in discriminating between successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

- The progressive improvement in performance suggests that Kickstarter has gradually become more predictable, with factors under the direct influence of creators, financial goals, duration, categories, and reputation, accounting for an increasing share of the success of campaigns. This pattern indicates not only the increase in the relevance of the structural variables analyzed, but also the probable relative reduction in the influence of external and qualitative factors, such as individual marketing or platform curation, which played a more decisive role in the first years. Crowdfunding on Kickstarter has evolved into a more mathematical and data-dependent landscape, where the creator's track record and strategic choices play increasing weight, making results less dependent on intangible factors. However, the qualitative component does not disappear, its impact on the prediction of success diminishes, but it persists as a source of residual variation.

- The analysis of the variable "duration" revealed clear changes in the pattern of the campaigns over time (Figure 4). In the early years of Kickstarter there was a heterogeneous distribution of deadlines, with greater dispersion between 20 and 60 days. From 2011 onwards, however, the predominance of 30-day campaigns was consolidated, which quickly became the dominant pattern of the platform. Alternate durations in multiples of five days, such as 15, 20, 45, and 60 days, remained secondary choices with much lower frequency. This standardization process indicates not only an adaptation of creators to the most popular and effective practices, but also the maturation of the platform itself, which began to consolidate expectations and norms around more defined and recognizable deadlines.

- The "financial goal" variable represents the minimum amount stipulated by project creators on Kickstarter for the initiative to be considered successful. This value works as a reference parameter where only when the final collection reaches or exceeds the goal are the resources effectively transferred to the proponent. The goals range from modest figures to extremely high amounts, reflecting the diversity of project types, areas of activity and degrees of ambition involved in the platform. The dashed line in Figure 5 illustrates this cut-off point, directly distinguishing the campaigns that did or did not achieve the established objective.

- The analysis shows that the higher the stipulated goal, the more difficult it becomes to achieve success. As described in the literature in relation to crowdfunding, most projects that do not obtain the required funding fail by a large margin, while successful projects are very close to the minimum funding threshold (Mollick, 2014). It is also possible to observe a significant number of initiatives that did not obtain any collection, suggesting fragility in dissemination or planning, considering that these are distributed over the entire range of the collection goal. These patterns reinforce the strategic importance of calibrating the financial goal because disproportionate amounts can compromise the viability of the campaign, while realistic goals significantly increase the likelihood of engagement and success.

Each dot represents a project, colored according to the outcome (success in orange; failure in blue). The dashed line indicates the cutoff point at which the collection equals the stipulated goal.

- The variable "creator's reputation" was measured based on the previous success rate, calculated by the ratio between the number of successful projects and the total number of projects launched by the same author. It is possible to observe a significant concentration of values in "0" (Figure 6), corresponding to creators with no history of success, either because they are newcomers or because they have not been able to finance previous initiatives. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a spike in "1", relative to creators who have been successful in all their previous projects. Between these two extremes, the density of cases is very low, revealing the rarity of creators with mixed portfolios, composed of both successes and failures.

- This pattern suggests that reputation on the platform tends to polarize, the absolute majority of creators either have no experience of success, or have a consistent track record of success. The presence of few intermediate profiles indicates that successful authors can accumulate social capital and credibility with the public, facilitating the replication of successful campaigns in new projects (Colombo et al., 2015). On the other hand, unsuccessful creators face greater difficulties in breaking this cycle, especially newcomers, who depend on additional visibility and trust strategies to break this barrier. Reputation stands out as a crucial factor for the performance of projects, marked by a strong asymmetry in the distribution among the platform's participants.

- The categories of the projects are configured as a fundamental explanatory variable to understand the dynamics of Kickstarter. The accelerated growth of the platform until 2015 brought a significant increase in the number of projects in practically all areas, followed by a decline and stabilization in recent years (Figure 7). In this scenario, some categories maintained a continuous presence, such as "Film & Video" and "Music", while others gained relevance at specific moments, such as "Games" and "Technology". On the other hand, areas such as "Dance" and "Journalism" remained in the minority, with proportionally reduced participation throughout the period.

Figure 7. Number of Kickstarter projects by category between 2009 and 2024. The top image shows the absolute values of projects, while the bottom panel shows the relative ratio to the total. The colors indicate different categories, as per the legend.

- When looking at the success rate (Figure 8), it is possible to observe that the peak of projects in 2014 and 2015 coincides with a sharp drop in the proportion of successful campaigns in all categories, a clear indication of platform saturation. The oversupply has intensified competition for funders' attention, and while some areas have gradually recovered, others have not returned to achieving high levels of success. Categories such as "Comics", "Design" and "Games" were able to resume and sustain high rates after the drop, showing greater resilience and the ability to engage specific communities. In contrast, "Food", "Technology" and "Journalism" remained at low levels, suggesting structural difficulties in attractiveness or fundraising.

- These patterns reveal that categories are not just a form of thematic segmentation, but a factor that strongly influences the chances of success. The temporal evolution shows that even in the face of the reduction in the absolute number of projects, the diversity of themes remained constant, but with uneven trajectories in terms of performance. In this way, the "Project Category" is confirmed as a critical variable in explaining success on Kickstarter, both because it reflects cultural and technological trends and because of its ability to sustain engagement in the face of periods of market saturation.

- In the first years of its existence, Kickstarter underwent accelerated growth, with a rapid increase in the number of projects and room for diversity of proposals. In this period, external and qualitative factors, such as the creator's charisma, the originality of the idea, and the ability to communicate, played a greater role in success than the variables analyzed. Categories such as "Film & Video" and "Music" were consolidated as popular early on, while "Games" began to gain relevance (Figure 7). In this same period, the variable "duration of the campaign" was established around more standardized formats until 2011 and 2012, reflecting a process of collective consolidation in the platform (Figure 4). This growth also translated into progressive predictive gains, where model performance, as measured by ROC-AUC, increased substantially over these years (Figure 3). Measurable features began in this period to efficiently capture the conditions for success in a scenario still marked by strong expansion.

- The peak of the expansion coincided with the saturation of the system in 2014 and 2015, when the number of projects reached almost 50 thousand per year. This oversupply caused a sharp drop in the success rate in practically all categories (Figure 8), revealing the limits of the platform in the face of project overload. The impact was felt even in established categories such as "Film & Video" and "Music," which saw marked declines in their success rates, while structurally fragile categories such as "Journalism"  remained at low levels. This saturation scenario also affected the explanatory power of the model, the predictive accuracy measured by the ROC-AUC fell sharply in 2014, reflecting the difficulty of mathematically capturing a context marked by extreme competition and external factors that overshadowed the effects of the features analyzed.

- After the saturation phase, the platform went through a process of reaccommodation and maturation, with a reduction in the absolute volume of projects, stabilization of thematic diversity and strengthening of explanatory standards. In this new scenario, the variables analyzed, such as "Financial Goal", "Reputation" and "Categories" (especially resilient groups such as "Comics", "Design" and "Games"), gained greater stability and predictive power. The success rate is no longer fluctuating sharply and is now more clearly reflecting the consistency of the projects and the history of the creators. Thus, the model trained with year-by-year data reached its highest ROC-AUC value and stabilized near 0.9. It is suggested here that the model approaches the limit of the explanatory power possible from these variables. This maturation suggests that the platform has become more predictable and "mathematical", with greater weight of quantitative and structural factors, although there is still room for the influence of qualitative and external elements.

- Crowdfunding can be understood from the perspective of the "backer" as an investor who, faced with uncertainty about the quality of a project, seeks objective signals to guide his decision (Agrawal et al., 2010). From this perspective, the features identified here, "financial goal", "campaign duration", "creator reputation" and "project category", work as structural variables that help to recognize patterns and form opinions. The public behaves as rational investors who weigh risk and return according to observable characteristics.

- The way projects are presented exerts a strong qualitative influence on the funding decision. Detailed descriptions, accompanied by images and videos, increase the perception of quality and transparency (Mollick, 2014; Koch, 2015). Frequent communication through updates also reinforces supporters' trust, signaling creators' commitment (Crosseto & Regner, 2014). These elements not only increase the visibility of the project, but also function as signs of professionalism and seriousness, fundamental in an environment where there are no formal guarantees of return.

- Despite the increasing predominance of measurable structural variables, there remains an important space for qualitative and contextual factors that models hardly capture. Elements such as the originality of the proposal, the cultural adequacy of the product, the timing of the launch, and the creator's capacity for narrative engagement act as competitive differentials in a saturated environment. Geographical and cultural aspects, for example, shape not only the type of project presented, but also its reception by the public (Mollick, 2014). In addition, subjective signals such as charisma, legitimacy, or the narrative built around the campaign can mobilize communities in a way that is disproportionate to what the metrics would indicate. Thus, the qualitative effects do not disappear, they remain as an explanatory component that helps to understand why similar projects in terms of goal, duration, category and reputation can still present very different results.

### Conclusion

- The trajectory of Kickstarter reveals a process of evolution and maturation that goes from an unstable and exploratory initial phase, marked by a strong influence of unpredictable and qualitative external factors, to a period of saturation in 2014 and 2015, followed by the consolidation of a more selective and predictable system. In this path, the analyzed variables gained increasing explanatory importance, the "financial goal", the "project duration", the "creator's reputation" and the "project category" affect success individually as well as interact with each other. Realistic financial goals, for example, become especially feasible in categories that historically accumulate high success rates, especially when proposed by creators with consolidated reputations. This interaction shows that success in crowdfunding results from the combination of multiple structural factors, and not from the isolated action of each variable.

- This maturation of the platform has both practical and analytical implications. For creators, understanding the current operating logic means learning how to realistically calibrate goals, decide on an appropriate duration, choose strategic categories, and explore successful portfolios as key assets. For analysts, the growing predictability of the system reinforces the feasibility of statistical and computational modeling capable of anticipating the results of campaigns. However, the stabilization and increasingly mathematical character of Kickstarter do not entirely eliminate the weight of external and qualitative factors, such as the originality of the proposal, the cultural context, or the capacity for social engagement. These elements, although increasingly secondary in the face of the weight of structural variables, continue to play an important role in an ecosystem that combines numbers, reputation and creativity. In this context, the present study contributes by presenting models with predictive capacity that raises the standard of previous initiatives and, together with a detailed temporal analysis, offers valuable insights for creators and investors interested in maximizing their chances of success.
