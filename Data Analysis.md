- The model trained with all the data showed robust performance in predicting the final state of the projects.
- LightGBM, assessed by five-fold stratified cross-validation, achieved a mean ROC-AUC of 0.800 ±0.001, indicating good discriminatory ability between successful and unsuccessful projects (Figure 1).
- These values demonstrate that the model was able to stably capture relevant patterns in the variables related to the breeder.

Figure 1. ROC curve of the trained LightGBM model with stratified cross-validation (k = 5).True positives are successfully funded Kickstarter projects and correctly predicted as such, while false positives are projects that did not reach their goal but were mistakenly classified as successful.

- Early crowdfunding modeling initiatives had already demonstrated the potential of computational approaches in which predictive algorithms achieved about 68% accuracy in the classification of campaigns (Greenberg et al., 2013). The present model, with a mean ROC-AUC of 0.80, adds to this result a more stable and high discriminatory capacity, evidencing the maturity of both the available data and the techniques applied to the problem. However, the still imperfect predictive capacity suggests that the set of features analyzed captures the factors under the creator's control, such as financial goals, duration, category and reputation, a significant part of the variability in the success of the projects depends on elements external to these parameters. Among them are individual marketing actions, engagement in social networks (Hsu, 2007), curation of the platform itself ("staff pick" and "spotlight" in the original database) and contextual factors such as economic conjunctures or cultural trends that affect audience engagement. Thus, the model shows robust predictive capacity, but also highlights the limits imposed by the absence of variables related to factors extrinsic to the breeder.

- The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis used to measure the importance of each feature used in the LightGBM model provides answers about the interaction of these variables with the increase in the probability of project success (Figure 2). The "Financial Goal" metric is inversely related to success, where larger goals lead to greater difficulty in the success of the campaign while smaller goals facilitate its successful financing. "Campaign duration" revealed a non-linear pattern in which short periods tend to increase the probability of success compared to long campaigns, but with inversion at the extremes, where excessively short durations reduce the reach of the initiative, while very long durations although less engaging can still lead to positive results at a more gradual pace. "Reputation" is represented in its levels "Always Success", strongly associated with the probability of success, and "Partial Success", also associated with success, but less influential. The categories present heterogeneous results where certain groups such as "design", "comics" and "games" contribute to the success of the project, while "journalism" is a negative factor.
