### Methodology

- The data used were obtained from the WebRobots (https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/) public access page, which transparently provides historical records from the Kickstarter platform. The data was collected through webscraping exclusively from publicly available information. The database was treated with the removal of irrelevant identifiers (IDs, URLs), removal of all projects from the year 2025 for maintenance only of full years, elimination of duplicates, standardization of units (financial values converted to $USD and time values to days) and applied logarithmic transformation to metric variables. The finished treated database consisted of 411,640 projects.

- Variables directly related to the creators of the projects were selected: "Parent Category", "Financial Goal" and "Duration". An additional variable "author's reputation" was constructed from the ratio between the number of successful projects and the total number of projects released by each creator ["Reputation" = ("n_successes"/"n_projects")]. This was categorized into three levels referring to the author's previous success ("never", "sometimes" or "always" was successful) and together with the variable "project category" converted into dummies variables.

- The selected features were used as explanatory variables in the training of supervised machine learning models. The response variable was defined as the final status of the project, categorized in binary form as successfully financed (1) or failed (0). Several algorithms were tested for their predictive capabilities and computational efficiency, which the LightGBM model was chosen as the most suitable. The parameters selected were: "n_estimators" = 600, "learning_rate" = 0.03, "max_depth" = 8, "subsample" = 1, "colsample_bytree" = 0.8 and "class_weight" = "balanced". The model was trained with stratified cross-validation with k-folds = 5 and an independent sample of 30% of the data was separated for external validation in a final fit test.  ROC-AUC was used as a metric to select and evaluate models.

- In addition to the general model, specific training was conducted using LightGMB with data segregated by year (2009 to 2024), in order to explore the temporal evolution of performance and the relevance of the variables. ROC-AUC was monitored along with the relative importance of features in each year. In a complementary way, the variables were investigated individually: "project category" was analyzed in absolute and relative terms of success and failure; "financial goal" as a function of the success rate in different value ranges; "duration of the campaign" according to its average annual variation; and the "author's reputation" for the distribution of its levels between successful and unsuccessful projects.
